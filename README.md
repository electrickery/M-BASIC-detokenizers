# M-BASIC-detokenizers

Repository started of as a copy of http://edmond.orignac.pagesperso-orange.fr/detokenizer.html, but with a first modification, I wanted to preserve the result.

The original appears to be from Christian Ratliff, but it is no longer found at his site at http://www.lily.org/users/cratliff/.

My very minor addition is the 'STEP' token in the CP/M M BASIC as found in generic CP/M machines as file and ROM-capsules in the Epson PX-8 and PX/4 laptops.

The original documentation is found in the README and README.2 files.
